            <h2>About This Project</h2>
            <p>
                The Pneumonia Detection System is designed to assist in the early diagnosis of pneumonia through the use of advanced deep learning techniques. By analyzing X-ray images of the lungs, this system aims to accurately determine whether a patient has pneumonia or if their lungs are healthy. Early detection is crucial for effective treatment and can significantly improve patient outcomes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Pneumonia is a serious lung infection that can lead to severe health complications, particularly in vulnerable populations such as the elderly and young children. Traditional methods of diagnosing pneumonia can be time-consuming and may require extensive medical knowledge. Our system simplifies this process by providing a user-friendly interface that allows users to upload X-ray images for rapid analysis.
            </p>
            <h2>Technology Behind the System</h2>
            <p>
                This project utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs), a class of deep learning algorithms particularly well-suited for image classification tasks. The CNN model has been trained on a large dataset of labeled X-ray images, enabling it to learn and recognize patterns indicative of pneumonia. By leveraging this technology, we aim to provide accurate and timely results to users, enhancing the overall efficiency of pneumonia diagnosis.
